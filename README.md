 Lumen is a Vulkan ray tracing framework that contains a variety of variance reduction techniques. Its aim is to accelerate some of the well-known rendering techniques in computer graphics literature with the help of the ray tracing hardware in modern GPUs. All the techniques Lumen implements run fully on the GPU.

## Features
 ### Rendering Techniques

 - Unidirectional Path Tracer with Multiple Importance Sampling (Path)
 - Bidirectional Path Tracer (BDPT)
 - Stochastic Progressive Photon Mapping (SPPM)
 - Vertex Connection and Merging (VCM)
 - Primary Sample Space Metropolis Light Transport (PSSMLT)
 - Combined VCM + MLT Integrator (VCMMLT)
 - ReSTIR
 - ReSTIR GI

### Engine
 - Lambertian, mirror, glass, glossy and optionally Disney BSDF
 - Spot (point), polygonal and directional lights
 - JSON-based scene system
 - Modified Mitsuba parser
 - A lightweight Vulkan abstraction layer from scratch
 - EXR output (F10)
 - On-the-fly RMSE computation

## Building

To build Lumen, start cloning the repository with

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/yuphin/Lumen.git
```

## Usage
Some of the sample scenes can be found in the `scenes/` directory.
Sample scene files with various integrators can be found in the `scenes/cornell_box/` directory.

### Requirements
- Turing+ or RDNA2 GPU
- VS2022 or VS2019

Currently, Lumen only builds on Windows, however, there is no platform specific code in the codebase and it can be ported to Linux with ease.
